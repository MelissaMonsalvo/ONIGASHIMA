    shiori "Good morning, [persistent.player_name]-sama~"

    shiori "I was just about to prepare the shrine for the red moon, and--"

    MC "Shiori-chan."

    MC "You still don't believe me, do you?"

    shiori "I--"

    shiori "[persistent.player_name]-sama. I believe you, I fully believe that you believe you've killed it, but..."

    shiori "Have you ever seen a cicada still move after its head comes off?"

    MC "..."

    shiori "Or a puppet that keeps dancing even when no one’s holding the strings?"

    shiori "We prepare because something always comes, [persistent.player_name]."

    shiori "That's what Hikaru and Yamato keeps telling me anyway..."

    n "None of you speak again for a while."

    n "..."

    shiori "Nee..."

    shiori "Could you bring me the incense box, [persistent.player_name]-sama?"

    MC "...Yeah."

    shiori "Thank you~"

    shiori "Now... Salt, incense, water, string~ This should keep the worst away."

    n "You just look at the ground, it feels like it's tilting below you."

    MC "*gulp*"

    shiori "Nee, [persistent.player_name]-sama~"

    ## sudden return to shiori's face

    MC "...!"

    n "Her breath suddenly brushes your cheek. When did she get so close?"

    MC "Shiori..."

    shiori "You’re trembling~"

    shiori "Nee, nee. Are you scared of me?"

    MC "No."

    shiori "Are you suuuuure~?"

    n "Her lips are right beside your ear now, the sound of her breath now echoing inside your skull."

    n "You didn't realize that your body spasms so hard it knocks down a candle."

    play sound "sfx/flame_burst.ogg"

    MC "-Ah!"

    n "The flame licks your wrist. Even though it burned off your sleeves, it feels like it's your flesh that is being torn apart too."

    play sound "sfx/burn.ogg"

    n "You pull your hand back, immediately."

    MC "Nngh-!"

    n "The wax lands on your skin-Oh."

    n "...It's... black?"

    MC "Why the hell is the wax black?!"

    n "It burned through the cloth, and you smell something foul. Is your flesh burning?"

    MC "Shiori, help--"

    n "She should be helping, or reach for something, anything, but..."

    n "She’s just watching you burn with that wide eyes of hers."

    shiori "You remember the charm I gave you, right?"

    MC "Seriously, is this the right time to talk about this--"

    shiori "The one I hid in your sleeve before you climbed the mountain. It's protecting you, see?"

    n "She points at the black goo melted right before your arm."

    n "Oh, so it's the charm that burned, not you. It's now charred and ash and tattered into pieces."

    shiori "You're fine, see?"

    n "You feel lightheaded immediately."

    MC "R-Really?"

    show shiori yandere at midright

    shiori "Of course~"

    shiori "You're always, always within my protection."

    n "You turn to leave, to clean your arm and get that blasted charm off you..."

    n "...but her hand closes around your wrist before you can move."

    shiori "Um, wait--!"

    shiori "Wait, just one more thing. Since you've burned off the charm..."

    shiori "Drink this instead and you'll not be marked when the red moon comes."

    MC "...What is it?"

    shiori "It's just wine~"

    n "Her hand shakes slightly as she hands you a cup, you can see a thick line runing down the outside."

    n "Your fingers feel sticky where it touches."

    n "You lift it to your mouth, something metallic fills your nose... then the taste swells on your tounge."

    play sound "sfx/gulp.ogg"

    n "It sticks to your palate and clots at the back of your throat as you gulp it down."

    MC "Hahh..."

    shiori "So? How was it?"

    MC "It's... {w}fine. I guess?"

    shiori "That's it? Just 'fine'? Nothing else?"

    MC "I mean... {w}It's wine, right? Wine's always good in my book."

    shiori "...Nevermind."

    shiori "It doesn’t matter."

    MC "...?" ## titlts their head

    shiori "Tomorrow is the Red Moon, [persistent.player_name]-sama."

    shiori "I... I can't wait."

    n "There's a weird glint in Shiori's eyes and the way she smiles when she turns away."

    n "You’re alone now, with the cup in your hand, the thick residue sliding down your throat..."

    n "... and the taste of iron still curling at the back of your mouth."

    n "The sky is almost fully red today."

    n "The villagesfolk starts whispering, you can hear it everywhere you walk."

    "Old Woman" "...If [persistent.player_name] really killed it..."

    "Young Man" "...Then nothing will happen tonight, right?"

    "Old Woman" "...Right?"

    n "Of course no one dares asking you directly, but you can feel their glances when they think you’re not looking."

    n "Everywhere you go, people walks away, and your friends are nowhere to be found."

    n "No Yamato or Hikaru around, either."

    n "Maybe they’re patrolling. {w}Maybe."

    n "But you know that Shiori will always be waiting at the same spot at the shrine."

    shiori "[persistent.player_name]-sama~"

    shiori "You came."

    MC "..."

    shiori "It’s almost time, you know."

    shiori "So~"

    shiori "Will you stay with Shiori tonight? At the shrine?"

    shiori "It’s scary, you know~ All this talk of the Oni possibly returning..."

    shiori "I need my big, strong Oni slayer to protect me~"

    n "Odd "

    n "Her hand no longer shakes as she looks at you, as if something had changed overnight."

    shiori "Nee, nee, you wouldn’t leave me alone on a night like this... Right...?"

    MC "Of course, Shiori."

    n "What on? This isn't the Shiori you know."

    n "Wait, is she always the Shiori you knew?"

    shiori "I was wondering when it started, y'know?"

    shiori "When I started looking at you and thinking... {w}you poor thing~"

    shiori "You risked your life for the village, and this is the thanks you get?"

    shiori "Hikaru and Yamato won't talk to you, and everyone doubts you really killed the oni..."

    shiori "They keep telling me something is wrong with you..."

    shiori "And now that I've done everything I can to prove otherwise, I failed."

    MC "Shut up."

    n "You kiss her back, then your lips moves down, down, down...."
